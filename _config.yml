about_content: |
  I'm Shubham and Research Intern at Center for Biomedical Image Comuting and Analytics (CBICA), University of Pennsylvania. 
  My Expertise include exploring Deep Learning Tools for Computer Vision Tasks such as Classification, Segmentation, Detection.  
  Currently working on H&E stained digital Histopathology Images for Prognostic Stratification of Glioblastoma.  
  I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work
  with something new. The things that I currently have the most experience working with are:
  <mark>Deep Learning</mark>,
  <mark>Computer Vision</mark>,
  <mark>Medical Imaging</mark>,
  <mark>Tensorflow</mark>,
  <mark>Pytorch</mark>,
  <mark>Git</mark> and 
  <mark>Python</mark>.

          Semantic Segmentation in Unstructured Environment with Modified DeepLabV3+
        description: |
          Encoder-Decoder architecture is developed for semantic scene segmentation in unstructured environment with various 
          backbones like InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNets using Deep Learning on Indian Driving Dataset (IDD) and IDD lite.

          The API for this site has been build using <mark>Node.js</mark> while the front end is a <mark>React</mark>/<mark>Redux</mark> app.
          I have used <mark>Docker</mark> to set up a development environment and <mark>Heroku</mark> to deploy and host the site. I have
          a suite of unit and API tests for the backend and unit tests for the front end.
          I have been using this project as a way to increase many of my skills and also learn new things, most recently sockets and Node.JS. I have particually
          enjoyed managing my own project and designing my own architecture and implementing this to a high standard.
          Feel free to check out the whole project on GitHub to get a feel for how I work [here](https://github.com/sproogen/itsgoingto.be).

          I started working for GWS Media part time during my third year at University and continued full time once I had
          graduated. It was during this role that I learnt many of the fundamentals that I have been building on over
          the past 3 years. Whilst at GWS I had the opportunity to work with:
          <mark>Drupal</mark>, <mark>Magento</mark>, <mark>Bootstrap</mark>, <mark>Codeigniter</mark>, <mark>Android</mark> and <mark>iOS</mark>.
          I feel like having the opportunity to use a large range of different things early on in my career has given me
          the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
